      <h1>National Service Scheme</h1>
      <p>
        National Service Scheme is a student centered programme and it is complementary to education. It is a noble experiment in academic extension. It inculcates the spirit of voluntary work among students and teachers through sustained community interaction. It brings our academic institutions closer to the society. It is a link between the campus and community, the college and village, knowledge and action.  The overall aim of NSS is the Personality Development of students through community service. It gives an extension dimension to Higher Education system and orients the student youth to community service.<br />

 The youth in all ages has been in the vanguard of progress and social change, thirst for freedom, impatience for quicker pace of progress and a passion for innovation, coupled with idealism and creative fervour, saw the youth in the forefront of the freedom struggle in our own land. Ever since independence there has been growing awareness of the desirability of involving students in National Service. The first Education Commission (1950) recommended the introduction of national service by students on a voluntary basis, but NSS was officially included in the curriculum for University students, along with National Sports Organization (NSO) and National Cadet Corps (NCC), after the Conference of State Education Ministers in April 1967.<br />

National Service Scheme, popularly known as NSS, was formally launched on 24th September, 1969, the birth centenary of the Father of the Nation. 24th September is celebrated every year as NSS Day nationwide.<br />

The scheme now extends to all the states and universities in the country. Students, teachers, parents, guardians, persons in authority in government, universities and colleges and the people in general now realize the need and significance of NSS. NSS is, thus a concrete attempt in making education relevant to the needs of the society.

          <h3>NSS LOGO</h3>
          <p>
            The symbol of the NSS is based on the ‘Rath’ wheel of the Konark Sun Temple situated in Orissa. These giant wheels of the Sun Temple portray the cycle of creation, preservation and release, and signify the movement in life across time and space. It stands for community as well as change and implies the continuous striving of National Service Scheme for social transformation and upliftment.
