            <div class="col2">Street play or Nukkad Natak is a form of theatrical performance in outdoor public spaces which aims at spreading awareness about various social and cultural issues prevailing in the society. NSS PEC has been organizing such plays for many years and the plays have gained so much appreciation which encourages them to do even better every year. Last year, Street Plays on “Harmful effects of Single use Plastic” was organized. These plays if and as they are targeted towards youth can really stir up emotions, create awareness and lead the way towards positive change. Nukad nataks are an important tool in creating awareness, empowering the youth and utilizing our right to freedom of speech and expression positively. This colloquial form of drama connects with the youth instantly. This enthusiasm if used in the correct manner can lead to drastic changes in our society, changes we wish for.
